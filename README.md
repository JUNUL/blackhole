> minimalistic but flexible and powerful SCSS / CSS framework

## Version 1.11 Released

Blackhole is a **minimalistic**, **semantic**, **modular**, but **powerful** and **flexible** SASS / CSS framework with the sole purpose of offering developers (you) a new approach on how they architect their websites / apps, aiming in making their work easy and pleasurable and giving the possibility of modifying and extending it the way they want.

It's a good and fast solution for prototyping your projects and creating a solid but flexible architecture for them, only leaving to you the process of **configuring**, **creating some unique design**, and maybe **extend things** based on your needs.

I decided to develop this framework because I am tired of seeing everywhere bad and redundant code making no sense, hard to implement, and lacking a lot of things that should improve your workflow.

Though is somehow an **opinionated** framework, I promise it will not force you into doing anything you dont't like, its **opinions** on doing things in certain ways are coming from solid backgrounds such as **good sense**, **flexibility** and **simplicity**.
